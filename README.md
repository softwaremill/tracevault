# TraceVault

> **Research Preview** — This project is under heavy development. APIs, configuration, and features may change significantly between releases.

![Analytics Overview](docs/images/analytics-overview.png)

AI code governance platform for enterprises. Captures what AI coding agents do in your repos — which files they touch, how many tokens they burn, what tools they call, what percentage of code is AI-generated — then enforces policies and produces tamper-evident audit trails for regulatory compliance.

Built for financial institutions and regulated industries where AI-generated code needs the same audit rigor as human-written code.

## Five Pillars of AI Governance

### 1. Capture — Full Session Tracing

Record every AI interaction with full fidelity. TraceVault hooks into AI coding agents and automatically captures session transcripts, token breakdowns (input/output/cache per model), every tool call invocation, file modifications with diffs, and cost estimates. Secrets and credentials are redacted before storage.

Nothing to configure — once initialized, capture is automatic and invisible.

### 2. Enforce — Policy Engine

Keep AI within bounds. Define rules per-repository that are evaluated on every push:

- **Model allowlists** — restrict which AI models can be used
- **Sensitive path protection** — flag AI edits to critical paths (`/payments/`, `/auth/`, `/crypto/`)
- **Required tool calls** — mandate security scanners or code review tools
- **AI percentage thresholds** — warn when AI-authored code exceeds a limit
- **Token budgets** — cap token usage or cost per session

Policies can either **block the push** (exit non-zero) or **warn**. Fail-closed by default: if the server is unreachable, the push is blocked.

### 3. Audit — Cryptographically Signed Chain of Events

Every trace pushed to the server is transformed into a tamper-proof record:

1. **Hashed** — SHA-256 digest of the canonical record
2. **Chained** — each hash links to the previous, forming a verifiable chain
3. **Signed** — Ed25519 digital signature proves authenticity
4. **Sealed** — timestamp marks when the record was finalized

Records are append-only — no updates, no deletes. Corrections create amendment records referencing the original. The entire chain can be verified at any time to prove nothing was altered or reordered.

Built-in compliance modes for **SOX** (7-year retention), **PCI-DSS** (1-year, WORM-equivalent), and **SR 11-7** (model risk management for banks). RBAC with five roles — including a dedicated **Auditor** role with read-only access to all traces and the audit log.

### 4. Analyze — Usage Analytics

Understand how AI is used across your team:

- **Token usage trends** over time, per model, per author
- **Model distribution** — which models are used most and where
- **Cost tracking** — estimated cost breakdown by model and team member
- **Cache savings** — how much prompt caching saves
- **AI attribution** — what percentage of your codebase is AI-generated
- **Author activity** — commits, tokens, and cost per developer

All available through the web dashboard with filterable time ranges and drill-down views.

### 5. Code — Stories & Documentation

See exactly what AI wrote, line by line. The code browser overlays AI attribution on your source files — highlighting which lines were AI-generated, which function or class they belong to (via tree-sitter scope detection), and linking back to the session that produced them.

**Story generation** turns raw traces into human-readable narratives: why the AI chose a particular pattern, what alternatives were considered, and what the developer's intent was. Auto-generated Architecture Decision Records give new team members full context without asking anyone.

## TraceVault & Visdom

TraceVault is complementary to [Visdom](https://virtuslab.com) (VirtusLab's Autonomous Software Factory platform). Where Visdom focuses on making agents work **fast and correctly** — providing context fabric, machine-speed CI, and auto-evaluation — TraceVault answers a different question: **how do you prove agents worked correctly, and why they made the decisions they did?**

|  | Visdom | TraceVault |
|--|--------|------------|
| **Focus** | Speed and quality | Accountability and audit |
| **Buyer** | CTO / Platform Lead | CCO / Internal Audit / CTO |
| **Value** | Agent writes better code faster | Proof of how and why code was created |
| **Measures** | Build time, iterations, throughput | AI code %, trace completeness, compliance |

Together they cover the full lifecycle: Visdom optimizes the agent's execution, TraceVault governs it.

## Architecture

Three Rust crates in a Cargo workspace:

- **tracevault-core** — domain types, policy engine (7 condition types), attribution engine (tree-sitter based), secret redactor
- **tracevault-cli** — CLI binary that hooks into Claude Code, captures traces locally, checks policies, pushes to server
- **tracevault-server** — axum HTTP server backed by PostgreSQL with Ed25519 signing, audit logging, RBAC, code browser

Plus a SvelteKit web dashboard and a GitHub Action for CI verification.

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable toolchain (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs))
- PostgreSQL 16+ (or Docker)
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm (for the web dashboard)
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)

## Quick Start

### 1. Build from source

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Binaries land in `target/release/`:
- `tracevault` (CLI)
- `tracevault-server`

### 2. Start the server with Docker Compose

```sh
# Generate an encryption key (required — encrypts per-org signing keys in the DB)
export TRACEVAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

docker compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL, the TraceVault server on port 3000, and the web dashboard on port 5173. Migrations run automatically on startup.

To run just the database (useful during development):

```sh
docker compose up -d db
```

### 3. Run the backend server locally (development)

If you want to run the Rust server directly (instead of via Docker), start PostgreSQL first, then:

```sh
# Database credentials (defaults match docker-compose)
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://tracevault:tracevault@localhost:5432/tracevault

# Server bind address
export HOST=0.0.0.0
export PORT=3000

# Encryption key for per-org signing keys (see "Keys & Secrets" below)
export TRACEVAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<base64-encoded-32-byte-key>

cargo run -p tracevault-server
```

Database migrations run automatically on startup.

### 4. Run the web dashboard

The frontend is a separate SvelteKit app that proxies API calls to the backend:

```sh
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The dashboard runs on `http://localhost:5173` and proxies API calls to `http://localhost:3000` by default. To point at a different backend, set `PUBLIC_API_URL`:

```sh
PUBLIC_API_URL=http://your-server:3000 pnpm dev
```

### 5. Initialize TraceVault in a repository

```sh
cd /path/to/your/repo
tracevault init
```

This creates a `.tracevault/` directory and installs a pre-push hook. The hook runs:

```sh
tracevault sync       # sync repo metadata with server
tracevault check      # evaluate policies against server rules (blocks push on failure)
tracevault push       # upload traces to server
```

The command also installs the Claude Code hook configuration in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "tracevault hook --event pre-tool-use",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "tracevault hook --event post-tool-use",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 6. Authenticate and push traces

```sh
# Log in to a TraceVault server (opens browser for device auth):
tracevault login --server-url https://your-server.example.com

# Push traces to the server:
tracevault push

# Check policies before pushing (also runs automatically via pre-push hook):
tracevault check

# View local session stats:
tracevault stats

# Verify commits are sealed on the server:
tracevault verify --range HEAD~5..HEAD
```

## Using with Claude Code

TraceVault is designed to work with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (Anthropic's CLI for Claude). Here's how to get started:

### 1. Install Claude Code

```sh
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### 2. Log in to Claude Code

```sh
claude login
```

This opens a browser for authentication with your Anthropic account.

### 3. Initialize TraceVault in your repo

```sh
cd /path/to/your/repo
tracevault login --server-url https://your-tracevault-server.example.com
tracevault init
```

That's it. From this point on, every Claude Code session in this repo is automatically traced — tool calls, file edits, token usage, and model info are captured and streamed to the TraceVault server. When you `git push`, the pre-push hook evaluates policies and uploads traces.

## Keys & Secrets

### Encryption key (`TRACEVAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`)

**Required.** AES-256 encryption key used to encrypt sensitive data at rest — including per-org Ed25519 signing keys, deploy keys, and API keys stored in the database.

Generate a 32-byte key and base64-encode it:

```sh
# Using openssl:
openssl rand -base64 32

# Or using Python:
python3 -c "import secrets, base64; print(base64.b64encode(secrets.token_bytes(32)).decode())"
```

Set it as an environment variable:

```sh
export TRACEVAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<output-from-above>
```

**Backup this key.** If lost, all encrypted data in the database (org signing keys, deploy keys, API keys) becomes unrecoverable. For production, store it in your secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) and inject it at deploy time.

### Per-org signing keys

Each organization gets its own Ed25519 signing key for the tamper-evident audit trail. These are **generated automatically** when an org is created (via the UI or API) and encrypted at rest using `TRACEVAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. You can also provide your own key during org creation.

To export an org's public key (for external verification):

```
GET /api/v1/orgs/{id}/compliance/public-key
```

### Database credentials

Default credentials (matching `docker-compose.yml`):

```sh
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://tracevault:tracevault@localhost:5432/tracevault
```

For production, use strong credentials and TLS:

```sh
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/tracevault?sslmode=require
```

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `tracevault init [--server-url URL]` | Initialize TraceVault in current repo, install pre-push hook and Claude Code hooks |
| `tracevault login --server-url URL` | Authenticate via device auth flow (opens browser) |
| `tracevault logout` | Clear local credentials |
| `tracevault hook --event <type>` | Handle a Claude Code hook event (reads JSON from stdin) |
| `tracevault sync` | Sync repo metadata with the server |
| `tracevault check` | Evaluate policies against server rules, exit non-zero if blocked |
| `tracevault push` | Push collected traces to the server |
| `tracevault stats` | Show local session statistics |
| `tracevault verify` | Verify commits are registered and sealed on the server (`--commits` or `--range`) |
| `tracevault status` | Show current session status (not yet implemented) |

## Policy Enforcement

Policies are managed per-repo through the web UI or API. Seven condition types:

| Condition | What it checks |
|-----------|---------------|
| Trace Completeness | Every commit has a corresponding trace |
| AI Percentage Threshold | Warns when AI-authored code exceeds a threshold |
| Model Allowlist | Only approved model families allowed |
| Sensitive Path Pattern | Flags AI edits to sensitive paths (payments, auth, crypto) |
| Required Tool Call | Ensures specific tools were called during the session |
| Conditional Tool Call | Requires a tool when files matching glob patterns are modified |
| Token Budget | Warns when token usage or cost exceeds limits |

Each policy has a configurable action:
- **Block Push** — `tracevault check` exits non-zero, preventing `git push`
- **Warn** — prints a warning but allows the push

Fail-closed: if the server is unreachable, `tracevault check` blocks the push.

## Compliance & Audit Trail

### Compliance Modes

| Mode | Min Retention | Signing | Chain Verification | Use Case |
|------|--------------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| SOX | 7 years | Required | Daily | Public companies, financial reporting systems |
| PCI-DSS | 1 year | Required | Daily | Payment processing, cardholder data environments |
| SR 11-7 | 3 years | Required | Weekly | Banks using AI models in risk/trading/compliance |
| Custom | Configurable | Configurable | Configurable | Mix-and-match for specific requirements |

Compliance mode is set per-organization. When active, the system enforces minimum retention periods and required signing — admins can increase but not decrease below framework minimums.

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

Five roles enforce separation of duties:

| Role | Push Traces | Manage Policies | View All Traces | View Audit Log | Manage Users |
|------|------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Owner | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Admin | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Policy Admin | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Developer | Yes | No | Own only | No | No |
| Auditor | No | No | Yes (read-only) | Yes (read-only) | No |

### Audit Log

Every state-changing operation is logged to an append-only audit trail:
- Trace creation and sealing
- Policy CRUD and check results
- User login/logout and registration
- Role changes
- Compliance settings updates
- Chain verification results

Query via API with filters (action type, actor, resource, date range) or browse in the web dashboard.

## GitHub Action

Add to your workflow to verify that commits in a PR or push have corresponding traces sealed on the server:

```yaml
- uses: softwaremill/tracevault@main
  with:
    server-url: https://your-tracevault-server.example.com
    api-key: ${{ secrets.TRACEVAULT_API_KEY }}
```

The action installs the TraceVault CLI, detects the commit range from the PR or push event, runs `tracevault verify --range`, and writes a pass/fail summary to the GitHub Actions step summary.

## Configuration

### CLI config (`.tracevault/config.toml`)

```toml
agent = "claude-code"
# server_url = "https://your-server.example.com"
# api_key = "your-api-key"
```

### Server environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://tracevault:tracevault@localhost:5432/tracevault` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Bind port |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | _(permissive)_ | Allowed CORS origin for web dashboard |
